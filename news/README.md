# Simple news app to demonstrate redux-sagas

This was created using newsapi.org

A simple news app, which takes keywords and searches for news articles relating to the searched terms

Relies on sagas to handle api requests and allows for a loading component to be displayed whilst news is being fetched.

## Todo:

* Expand News component to show more than just the title of the first article shown
* Allow for the searching of multiple keywords 
* Allow for additional API options to be used (sources, domains, timespans etc.)
* Create an action channel for news api (maybe add login as additional channel?)


## Usage:
* clone repository
* npm install && npm start
* Can be accessed at localhost:3000
